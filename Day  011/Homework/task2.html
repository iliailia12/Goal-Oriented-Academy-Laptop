             <h2>What does a Python developer do?</h2>
             <p>A developer uses Python to write and work on code for software and more.
                 Python developers work in many industries, such as IT, software development,
                 # science, education, finance, health, manufacturing, banking, and more. A
                  Python developer works in a role with that specific name. Many people also use it as
                 an umbrella term for all computer science professionals using Python.

                You may perform various tasks as a Python developer, including web
                , app, and game development. You might work on the back end of websites to 
                enhance performance, or you could develop algorithms and predictive models
                 for artificial intelligence and machine learning. While the role can be c
            
                 omplex and varied, developing the right skills can prepare you. </p>

                    What are Python developer skills?
                    Whether you are deciding which courses to take or deciding which 
                    applicant to hire, you’ll find many key skills that a Python developer
                     ought to have. Every job might call for different specialisations or other
                      training, but in general, every Python developer ought to have the following skills:
                    
                    Core Python: (Iterators, Generators, Data structure) are Python's basic language 
                    and core elements. 
                    
                    Web Frameworks: (Django, Flask) Web frameworks are necessary for building websites.
                     This skill is required for Python developers working on web applications.
                     Django and Flask are popular frameworks, although many other choices are available.
                    
                     
                    
                    Front-End Tech: (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3) Front-end tech supports the website's front

            
                     end or the elements the user sees. Like web frameworks, this 
                     skill is more important for Python developers who work on websites.
                    
                     
                    
                    Object Relational Mappers (ORM): (Hibernate, Dapper) Object-relational mappers
                     are tools used to interact with databases. Python developers who will be
                      working with data and databases should understand ORMs. 
                    
                    Python Libraries: (NumPy, SciPy, SciKit Learn, Pandas) Python has libraries 
                    for almost anything. Whether creating a website or a video game, conducting
                     scientific research, or managing data for an online retailer, Python libraries
                      support whatever you do. A Python developer will need to have skills with a
                       variety of Python libraries. 
                    
                    Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: You can use Python for machine 
                    learning, such as virtual personal assistants, social media suggestions, online
                     customer support, product recommendations, and more. 
                    

                    Audio/Visual, Natural Language Processors: Audio processors, video processors,
                     and natural language processors are essential for Python developers in many fields,
                      from data scientists to developers working on OTT video streaming.
                    
                     
                    
                    General Python developer skills: All developers, regardless of their specialisation, 
                    can benefit from analytical, design, and logical thinking skills.
