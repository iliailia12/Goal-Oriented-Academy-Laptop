            <h1>History about Audi</h1>
            <p>Audi AG (German: [ˈaʊ̯di ʔaːˈɡeː] ⓘ) is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles
                 headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. A subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, Audi 
                 produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.

                The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century 
                and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch 
                (1868–1951). Two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer) also contributed to the foundation 
                of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired 
                by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[9] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction 
                of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating 
                the present-day form of the company.
                
                The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the 
                founder, August Horch. Horch, meaning 'listen', becomes audi in Latin. The four 
                rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create
                 Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, which is
                  translated as 'Progress through Technology'.[10] Audi, along with German brands BMW and 
                  Mercedes-Benz, is among the best-selling luxury 
                automobile brands in the world.[11]</p>

                <h2>History about how created audi</h2>
                <p>Birth of the company and its name
                    Automobile company Wanderer was originally established in 1885, later becoming a branch
                     of Audi AG. Another company, NSU, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during
                      this time, and later supplied the chassis for Gottlieb Daimler's four-wheeler.[12]
                    
                    On 14 November 1899, August Horch (1868–1951) established the company A. Horch & Cie. in
                     the Ehrenfeld district of Cologne. In 1902, he moved with his company to Reichenbach im
                      Vogtland. On 10 May 1904, he founded the August Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, a 
                      joint-stock company in Zwickau (State of Saxony).
                    
                    After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and
                     founded in Zwickau on 16 July 1909, his second company, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH
                      His former partners sued him for trademark infringement. The German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court)
                       in Leipzig,[13] eventually determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.[14]
                    
                    
                    1923 Audi Type E
                    Since August Horch was prohibited from using horch as a trade name in his new car business, he 
                    called a meeting with close business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau. At the 
                    apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company.
                     During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several
                      times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but
                     would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, "Father – 
                     audiatur et altera pars... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it audi instead of horch?".[15] Horch in German means 'hark' or 'hear', which is Audi in the singular imperative form of audire—'to listen'—in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting.[16] On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau (from 1915 on Audiwerke AG Zwickau) was entered in the company's register of Zwickau registration court.
                    
                    The first Audi automobile, the Audi Type A 10/22 hp (16 kW) Sport-Phaeton, was produced in
                     the same year,[17] followed by the successor Type B 10/28PS in the same year.[18]
                    
                    Audi started with a 2,612 cc inline-four engine model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model,
                     as well as 4,680 cc and 5,720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events.
                      The first six-cylinder model Type M, 4,655 cc appeared in 1924.[19]
                    
                    August Horch left the Audiwerke in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport,
                     but he was still involved with Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921
                     , Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present a production car, the Audi Type
                      K, with left-handed drive.[20] Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 
                      1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer[20] 
                      when driving on the right.</p>

                        Richard Bruhn, a Nazi party member, was Auto Union’s Chairman of the Board from 1932 to 1945 and then 
                        again after the war when the company was reestablished. In 2014 Audi became the last major
                         German car company, after Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler, to commission a study of their wartime
                          activities.[22] The investigation found that the company worked with the SS to build seven
                           labor camps where more than 3,700 prisoners were put to work for Auto Union.[23] In addition,
                            16,500 more people were forced to work at the company's factories in Zwickau and Chemnitz,
                             and another 18,000 at an underground plant in Bavaria where 4,500 people died.[24]
                        

                        Some of the company's factories were bombed by the Allies.[citation

                        IFA F9
                        With no prospect of continuing production in Soviet-controlled East Germany,
                         Auto Union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to West
                          Germany.[citation needed] A site was chosen in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, to start a spare parts 
                          operation in late 1945, which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed 
                          Auto Union in 1949.[citation needed]
                        
                        On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register.[21]
                         These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany's Auto Union AG. The remains of the Audi
                          plant of Zwickau became the VEB (for "People Owned Enterprise") Automobilwerk Zwickau [de]
                           or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).
                        
                        The former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war models in 1949. These
                         DKW models were renamed to IFA F8 and IFA F9 and were similar to the West German versions.
                          West and East German models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke
                           engines. The Zwickau plant later manufactured the infamous Trabant until 1991, after
                            it was acquired by the Volkswagen Group following the reunification of Germany, and
                             has since been substantially rebuilt. In 2021, production of the Audi Q4 e-tron began
                              at the plant, marking the return of Audis being manufactured at Zwickau after over 80 years.</p>
                              <h4>New Auto Union unit and how evulution audi and his factory</h4>
                              <p>A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt with loans from the 
                                Bavarian state government and Marshall Plan aid.[25] The reformed company was launched 3 
                                September 1949 and continued DKW's tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with
                                 two-stroke engines.[25] This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc motorcycle
                                  and a DKW delivery van, the DKW F89 L at Ingolstadt. The Ingolstadt site was large,
                                   consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable 
                                   for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage 
                                   there was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles: 
                                   for manufacturing the company's first post-war mass-market passenger car plant capacity
                                    in Düsseldorf was rented from Rheinmetall-Borsig. It was only ten years later, after
                                     the company had attracted an investor, when funds became available for construction 
                                     of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.


                                In 1958, in response to pressure from Friedrich Flick, then the company's largest single
                                 shareholder,[26] Daimler-Benz took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was
                                  increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus
                                   of Daimler-Benz's interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes
                                    models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union's, the company's aging model range
                                     at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent
                                      as competitor manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Opel. The decision to dispose of the Auto
                                       Union business was based on its lack of profitability.[27] Ironically, by the time they
                                        sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern 
                                        four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to
                                         embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or DKWs, but 
                                         using the "Audi" name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.
                                         <img src="../Pictures/220px-Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F038791-0035,_Wolfsburg,_VW_Autowerk.jpg" alt="" width="500">
                                   
                                In 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in
                                 Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had 
                                 been funded by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the Düsseldorf
                                  factory which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought 
                                  complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant
                                   to assemble an additional 60,000 Volkswagen Beetles per year.[28] Two-stroke engines became less 
                                   popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In
                                    September 1965, the DKW F102 was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a facelift for the car's 
                                    front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke 
                                    technology, and having classified the model internally as the F103, sold it simply as the 
                                    "Audi". Later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and
                                     sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen 
                                     was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models
                                      having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the 
                                      Ingolstadt assembly plant—to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the
                                       Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings
                                       . Then VW chief Heinz Nordhoff explicitly forbade Auto Union from any further product
                                        development. Fearing that Volkswagen had no long-term ambition for the Audi brand, 
                                        Auto Union engineers under the leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first Audi 
                                        100 in secret, without Nordhoff's knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype,
                                         Nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched 
                                         in 1968, went on to be a huge success. With this, the resurrection of the Audi brand 
                                         was now complete, this being followed by the first generation Audi 80 in 1972, which 
                                         would in turn provide a template for VW's new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range
                                          which debuted from the mid-1970s onward.
                                

                                
                                Audi 80 assembly line in Wolfsburg, 1973
                                In 1969, Auto Union merged with NSU, based in Neckarsulm, near Stuttgart.
                                 In the 1950s, NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but
                                  had moved on
                                  to produce small cars like the NSU Prinz, the TT and TTS versions of which are
                                   still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based
                                    on the ideas of Felix Wankel. In 1967, the new NSU Ro 80 was a car well ahead
                                     of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety.
                                      However, teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence
                                       of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models A6
                                        and A8. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the "quattro GmbH" (from November
                                         2016 "Audi Sport GmbH"), a subsidiary responsible for development and production
                                          of Audi high-performance models: the R8 and the RS model range.

                                The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as Audi NSU Auto Unio
                                n AG, with its headquarters at NSU's Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as
                                 a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the
                                  Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year. That same year, the mid-sized

                                   the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic NSU Ro 80, was instead launched as a Volkswagen.
                                

                                After the launch of the Audi 100 of 1968, the Audi 80/Fox (which formed the basis for the 
                                1973 Volkswagen Passat) followed in 1972 and the Audi 50 (later rebadged as the Volkswagen Polo) 
                                in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the Golf/Polo
                                 concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car. Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 
                                 (progenitors of the A4 and A6, respectively) became the company's biggest sellers, whilst 
                                  little investment was made in the fading NSU range; the Prinz models were dropped in 1973 
                                  whilst the fatally flawed NSU Ro80 went out of production in 1977, spelling the effective 
                                  end of the NSU brand. Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved from Ingolstadt 
                                  to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, and by the appearance of the second generation 
                                  C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant. Neckarsulm from that point
                                   onward would produce Audi's higher-end models.
                                
                                The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer 
                                Jörg Bensinger[29] was accepted to develop the four-wheel drive technology in Volkswagen's
                                 Iltis military vehicle for an Audi performance car and rally racing car. The performance
                                 car, introduced in 1980, was named the "Audi Quattro", a turbocharged coupé which was also
                                  the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent all-wheel drive through
                                   a centre differential. Commonly referred to as the "Ur-Quattro" (the "Ur-" prefix is a German
                                    augmentative used, in this case, to mean 'original' and is also applied to the first 
                                    generation of Audi's S4 and S6 Sport Saloons, as in "UrS4" and "UrS6"), few of these
                                     vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great
                                      success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel-drive racecars
                                      , and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.
                                

                                In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's officia
                                l name was now shortened to simply Audi AG. At the same time the company's headquarters
                                 moved back to Ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries; Auto Union GmbH and NSU
                                  GmbH, were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property
                                   of the original constituent companies (the exception being Horch, which had been retained
                                    by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi's heritage operations.

                                Audi Quattro
                                In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of "grandfather's car" image, the 
                                type 89 was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its
                                 modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base packag
                                 e was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option). In 1987, Audi put forward
                                  a new and very elegant Audi 90, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early
                                   1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started
                                    to surface.
                                
                                Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against
                                 German automakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990.
                                  It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork 
                                  differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.
                                
                                By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder Audi 90 and Audi 100, the 
                                turbocharged Audi 200 and the Audi V8. There was also a coupé version of the 80/90
                                 with both four- and five-cylinder engines.
                                
                                Although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still
                                 a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi
                                  100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8L V6 engine. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted 
                                  Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a 
                                  choice of four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines, in saloon, coupé and convertible body styles.
                                
                                The five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a turbocharged 220 PS
                                 (160 kW; 220 hp) version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 
                                 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the Sport Quattro. It was fitted to the Audi 
                                 Coupé, named the S2, and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the S4. These two models were 
                                 the beginning of the mass-produced S series of performance cars.
