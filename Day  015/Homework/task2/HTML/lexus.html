        <header>Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker
             Toyota Motor Corporation. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and 
             territories worldwide[3][6] and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. It has 
             ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value.[7] Lexus is headquartered in 
            Nagoya, Japan. Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas,
             United States.

            Created at around the same time as Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura
             and Infiniti luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project to
              develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the 
              launch of the Lexus LS in 1989.[8] Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, 
              convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and 
              all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under
               the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossovr
                debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its
                 own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed 
                 by the LFA supercar in 2009.
            
            Lexus vehicles are largely produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and
             Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka, 
             Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus produced outside the country, the Canadian-built 
             RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus began 
             operating its own design, engineering and manufacturing centers.
            
            Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market, the United States.
             The division inaugurated dealerships in the Japanese domestic market in 2005, becoming 
             the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin.[9] The brand 
             has since debuted in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe and other regions, and has
              introduced hybrid vehicles in many markets.</header>

              <main>History
                1980s: The F1 project
                The Lexus brand was created around the same time as Japanese rivals Nissan
                 and Honda developed their Infiniti and Acura premium brands. The Japanese 
                 government imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S. market, so it was
                 
                 more profitable for Japanese automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S.
                
                In 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda issued a challenge to build
                 the world's best car.[10] The project, code-named F1 ("Flagship
                  One")[11] developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota's product 
                  line in the premium segment.[12] The F1 project followed the Toyota 
                  Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models.[13] Both the Supra
                   and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE in
                   line-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production,
                    1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built
                 limousine, and V8-powered model,[14] followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium
                  sedan.[14][15] The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with the
                   Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982.[15] The F1 designers targeted their new 
                   sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.[14][15]

                Japanese manufacturers exported more expensive models in the 1980s due to voluntary
                n 1986, Toyota's longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the new brand.[17] Image consulting firm Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates.[24] While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars (being associated with the Alexis Carrington character on the popular 1980s prime time drama Dynasty).[24][25] As a result, the first letter was removed and the "i" replaced with a "u" to morph the name to Lexus.[25]

Theories of the etymology of the Lexus name have suggested it is the combination of the words "luxury" and 
"elegance",[26] and that it is an acronym for "luxury exports to the U.S."[26] According to Team One
 interviews, the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological
  image.[24] Prior to the release of the first vehicles, database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary 
  =injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used because it might cause product confusion.[27] The
   injunction threatened to delay the division's launch and marketing efforts.[27] The U.S. appeals court
    lifted the injunction, deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products.
    [27]

The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in
 Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became "The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection.
 "[28] Three firms were involved in the final phase of logo development: Saatchi & Saatchi, Molly
 
 Designs and Hunter/Korobkin, Inc.[29] The finished logo was a combination of two firms' final
 = designs: the Lexus logo typeface came from Saatchi & Saatchi and the "L" was Hunter/Korobkin,
  Inc.'s design. According to Toyota, the automaker made some refinements so the logo would be easier 
  to manufacture, rendering it using a mathematical formula.[30][24] The first teaser ads featuring 
  the Lexus name and logo appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles and New York auto shows in 1988.[31]
                export restraints negotiated by the Japanese government 
                and U.S. trade representatives 
                that restricted mainstream car sales.[16] In 1986, Honda launched its 
                Acura marque in
                 the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division.[17] The initial 
                 Acura model was
                  an export version of the Honda Legend,
                  itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Gloria and 
                  Mazda Luce.[18] In 1987, Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti,[19] and 
                  revised its Nissan President sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti 
                  Q45, which it launched in 1990.[20]
                 Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America in 1988 and later began plans
                  to develop an upscale marque to be called Amati, but its plans did not come to fruition.[19]
                
                Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct focus groups and
                 market research on luxury consumers.[21] During that time, several F1 designers rented
                  a home 
                 in Laguna Beach, California, to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American 
                 upper class 
                 consumers.[21] Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations
                  ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads.[22] Toyota's market research concluded
                   that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new sedan, and 
                   plans were
                    made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.[23]</main>
                    <h2>Lexux second model car   launch</h2>
                    <p>The LS 400 was praised for its quietness, well-appointed and ergonomic interior,
                         engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value.[22][37]
                          However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a 
                          suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort.[22][38] In 
                        some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models.[39]
                         It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as better than the higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 
                         SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance.[40] The LS 400 also won motoring
                          awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine.[41][42]
                           Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded as a shock to
                            existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 
                            19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while
                             35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.[40]

                        In December 1989, Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s
                         based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light.[40] A
                          20-day operation to replace the parts on affected vehicles included technicians to pick up,
                           repair and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flying personnel and renting
                            garage space for owners in remote locations.[40] This response was covered in media publications
                             and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.[43][44]
                        
                        By the end of 1989, a total of 16,392 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans were sold in the four months 
                        following the U.S. launch.[45] Although sales had begun at a slower pace than expected, the
                         final tally matched the division's target of 16,000 units for that year.[46] Following initial
                          models, plans called for the addition of a sports coupe along with a redesigned ES sedan.[47]</p>

                            1998 RX 300, first Lexus crossover SUV
                            In 1990, during its first full year of sales, Lexus sold 63,594 LS 400 and ES 250 
                            sedans in the U.S.,[48] the majority being the LS model.[48] That year, Lexus also
                             began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada and Australia.
                             [22][49] In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, the SC 400, which shared
                              the LS 400s V8 engine and rear-wheel drive design.[47] This was followed by the 
                              second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus' top
                               seller.[47] At the conclusion of 1991, Lexus had become the top-selling premium 
                               car import in the U.S.,[50][51] with sales reaching 71,206 vehicles.[48] That year, 
                               Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates' studies on initial vehicle quality, 
                               customer satisfaction and sales satisfaction for the first time.[52] The marque also began 
                               
                               increasing U.S. model prices past those of
                             comparable American premium makes, but still below high-end European models.[51] By 1992, the LS 
                             400's base price had risen 18 percent.[53]
                            
                            In 1993, Lexus launched the mid-size GS 300 sports sedan, based on the Toyota Aristo using the
                             Toyota "S" platform from the Toyota Crown, which had sold for two years prior in Japan.[47]
                              The GS 300 was priced below the LS 400 in the marque's lineup.[54] That same year, Lexus 
                              became one of the first marques to debut a certified pre-owned program, with the aim of 
                              improving trade-in model values.[55] The marque introduced the second generation LS 400
                               in 1994.[56] In May 1995, sales were threatened by the U.S. government's proposal of 100 
                               percent tariffs on upscale Japanese cars in response to the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit.
                               [57] SUVs were exempt from the proposed sanctions.[58] Normal sales operations resumed by late
                                1995 when the Japanese auto manufacturers collectively agreed to greater American investments
                                 and the tariffs were not enacted.[57]

                            ES 300 was the best-selling Lexus sedan in the 1990s.
                            In 1996, Lexus debuted its first sport utility vehicle, the LX 450,[59] followed by the third 
                            generation ES 300 sedan, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1997. The marque's 
                            plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995.[58] 
                            Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300 in 1998. The RX crossover targeted
                             suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability.[60] It
                              was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES
                               sedan.[60] The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it
                                launched sales in Brazil.[61][62] In 1999, the IS was introduced, an entry-level sport sedan. 
                                Lexus also recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market,[50] being ranked as the 
                                top-selling premium car maker in the U.S.

                             <p>n July 2000, Lexus introduced the IS 300 in North America, following
                                 global launch in 1999 (as the IS 200) and the third generation LS 430.
                                  In 2001, the first convertible was introduced, as well as the SC 430 
                                  and a redesigned ES 300.[63] The GX 470 mid-size SUV debuted in 2002,
                                   followed by the second generation RX 330 in 2003.[64] The following
                                    year, Lexus recorded its 2 millionth U.S. vehicle sale,[65][66] and
                                     the first luxury-branded production hybrid SUV, the RX 400h.[67] 
                                     This vehicle used Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive
                                 system that combined gasoline and electric motors.[68]

                                In 2005, Lexus completed an organizational separation from parent company 
                                Toyota,[69] with dedicated design, engineering, training, and manufacturing centers working exclusively for the division.[70][71] This effort coincided with Lexus' launch in its home market of Japan and an expanded global launch of the brand in markets such as China.[71][72] Executives aimed to increase Lexus sales outside of its largest market in the U.S.[71][73] To accompany this expansion, next generation Lexus vehicles were redesigned as "global models" for international release.[74] In the European market, where Lexus had long faced struggling sales owing to low brand recognition, few dedicated dealerships, and 1990s import quotas,[75][76] the marque announced plans to introduce hybrid and diesel powertrains,[77] increase the number of Lexus dealerships, and expand operations in emerging markets such as Russia.[78][79]

                                    Store locations.[80][81] Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price 
                                    premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts.[80] Sales for the first half-year 
                                    were slower than expected,[82] affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price
                                     increases,[83] but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.[83][84]
                                
                                Through the mid-2000s, Lexus experienced sales successes in South Korea and Taiwan, becoming the
                                 top-selling import make in both markets in 2005;[85][86] the marque also sold well in the Middl
                                 e East, where it ranked first or second among rivals in multiple countries,[87] and in Australia,
                                  where Lexus reached third in luxury car sales in 2006.[88][89] Division executives in 2006 announced
                                   an expansion goal from 68 countries to 76 worldwide by 2010.[90] By the end of the decade, this
                                    expansion resulted in official launches in Malaysia and South
                                     Africa in 2006,[91][92] Indonesia in 2007,[93] Chile in 2008,
                                     [94][95] and the Philippines in 2009.[96]
                                
                                Hybrids and F models
                                In 2006, Lexus began sales of the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid performance 
                                sedan,[97] and launched the fourth generation LS line, comprising 
                                both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid
                                 (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions.[98] The fifth generation ES 350 also
                                  debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as
                                   the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan.[99] By the end of
                                    2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide.[100] In January
                                     2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired
                                      versions of its performance models. The IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American 
                                      International Auto Show,[101] accompanied by a concept car, the LF-A.

                                In October 2007, Lexus entered the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in the U.S.
                                 for the first time with the IS F, and announced its F-Sport performance trim level and 
                                 factory-sanctioned accessory line.[102] Increased emphasis on sporty models was an effort 
                                 to target rivals from Mercedes-Benz's AMG and BMW's M divisions.[101][103] Models such as
                                  the SC 400 and GS 400 had received favorable reactions from sport luxury buyers,[104] 
                                  most Lexus models had been characterized as favoring comfort over sporty road feel and
                                   handling, compared with European rivals.[105] By the end of 2007, Lexus annual worldwide 
                                   sales had surpassed 500,000 vehicles,[106] and the marque ranked as the top-selling premium 
                                   import in China for the first time.[107] The largest sales markets in order of size for 2007
                                    were the U.S., Japan, the UK, China, Canada, and Russia.[100][108]
                                
                                In 2008, amidst the late-2000s recession and a weakened world car market, global sales 
                                fell 16 percent to 435,000,[109][110][111] with declines in markets such as the U.S. and Europe where deliveries fell by 21 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively.[112][113] In 2009, the marque launched the HS 250h,[114] a dedicated hybrid sedan for North America and Japan, the RX 450h, the second generation hybrid SUV replacing the earlier RX 400h, and later that year debuted the US$375,000 production LFA exotic coupe.[115] In late 2009, citing higher sales of hybrid models over their petrol counterparts,[116][117] Lexus announced plans to become a hybrid-only marque in Europe.[118] By the end of the decade, Lexus ranked as the fourth-largest premium car make in the world by volume,[119] and was the number one selling premium car marque in the U.S. for 10 consecutive years.[111][119][120]

                                In 2010, Lexus underwent a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the
                                 marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives.[87] Sales in the U.S.
                                  held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included 
                                  Lexus models.[121] The ES 350 and certain IS models were affected by a recall for 
                                  potentially jamming floor mats,[121] while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of 
                                  negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem 
                                  rates per-vehicle.[121][122] The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in 
                                  April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation
                                   not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control
                                    response to a high-speed emergency turn.[123] Although the publication knew of no repor
                                    ted incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.[123]

<h5>Lexux when company get global</h5>
                                
                                In late 2010 and early 2011, Lexus began sales of the CT 200h, a compact four-door hybrid
                                 hatchback designed for Europe, in multiple markets.[124][125] Sales of lower-displacemen
                                 t regional models were also expanded, beginning with the ES 240 in China followed by the 
                                 RX 270; Japan, Russia, and Taiwan were among markets which received model variants intended
                                  for reduced emissions or import taxes.[126][127] In March 2011, the Tōhoku earthquake and
                                   tsunami caused severe disruption to Lexus' Japan-based production lines, hindering the
                                    marque's near-term sales prospects.[128] Lexus' U.S. executives stated that due to 
                                    vehicle shortages amidst close competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, the
                                     marque would not remain the country's top-selling premium car brand.[128]
                                
                                Front quarter view of a hatchback.

                                 market,[129] along with sales increases of 40 percent and 27 percent in Europe and 
                                 Japan respectively,[130][131] for a global sales total of 410,000 units.[132] Lexus'
                                  streak of 11 consecutive years as the best-selling luxury marque in the U.S. ended 
                                  that year, with the title going to BMW followed by Mercedes-Benz.[133] While 45 percent 
                                  of Lexus sales in the U.S. in 2011 relied upon the RX luxury crossover SUV, rival Mercedes-Benz's
                                   best-selling offering was the E-Class mid-luxury sedan, which commands considerably higher
                                    prices.[134] Subsequently, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda vowed to restore passion to the marque 
                                    and further increase its organizational independence, admitting that "...back then we did not
                                     regard Lexus as a brand, but as a distribution channel". As a result of Toyoda's organizational
                                      changes, Lexus senior managers report directly to the chairman for the first time in the marque's
                                       history.[133][134]
                                
                                In January 2012, the marque began sales of the fourth generation GS line, including GS 350 and GS
                                 450h variants, as well as a lower-displacement GS 250 model for select markets.[135] In April 2012,
                                  the sixth generation ES line, including ES 350 and ES 300h variants, debuted at the New York
                                   International Auto Show.[136]
                                
                                
                                The fourth-generation LS’ production of eleven years made it the longest running
                                 single-generation Lexus.
                                In April 2014, Lexus unveiled the five-seater NX crossover. The vehicle features a very 
                                first for a Lexus vehicle: a turbocharger. Its nomenclature is denoted as the 200t. In 
                                August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its Lexus spare parts prices in China 
                                by up to 35 percent. The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed
                                 earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Lexus spare
                                  parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator
                                   considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales
                                    servicing.[137]
                                
                                In March 2016, Lexus announced that it will be producing a new flagship vehicle: the two-door
                                 LC 500. The vehicle will be produced for late 2017 in a V8 version putting out 467 horsepower.
                                  The LC 500h, a V6 hybrid variant, could potentially become available in late 2017 or early 2018.
                                
                                In April 2019, Lexus announced that a rebadged limousine version of the third-generation Toyota
                                 Alphard would be sold as the Lexus LM.[138] It was also announced that Lexus would finally enter
                                  the market in Mexico in 2021 with some of the vehicles in their lineup.[139] In October 2019, 
                                  Lexus announced that it will be launching the brand's first all-battery electric vehicle in 2020, 
                                  which is the UX 300e.[140][141] In June 2023, Lexus introduced its first vehicle in the B-segment,
                                   the LBX, which went on sale in Europe, Japan, Australia and 
                                   Southeast Asia.[142][143][144]</p>
