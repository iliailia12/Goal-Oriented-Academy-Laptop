                <h1>suppra</h1>
                The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports
                car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 
                1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above",
                 "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3]

The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has
 been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original
  Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was longer.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the
   A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the
    prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica'
    s name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third
     generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the
      fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation 
      of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.

The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first 
three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine.
 Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, Toyota
  also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being
   blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced.
    The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon
     design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current
      oval company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was.
       It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially 
       Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also 
       discontinued.[citation needed]

In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth-generation Supra in the United States.[6]
 Production of the fourth-generation Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In 
 January 2019, the fifth-generation Supra, which was co-developed with the

    The first generation of the Supra was based largely upon the Toyota
     Celica liftback, but was longer by 129.5 mm (5.10 in). The doors and rear
      section were shared with the Celica but the front panels were elongated 
      to accommodate the Inline-6 instead of the Celica's 4-cylinder engine.
       Toyota's created the Celica Supra after receiving requests from North 
       American dealerships to offer a competitor to the very popular Datsun 
       280Z.[9] The Celica XX (in Japanese) served as the basis of the Toyota
        CAL-1 which was introduced at the 1977 Tokyo Motor Show and the Celica
         XX was introduced later in 1978.[9] The Celica XX followed a new product
          offering Toyota had introduced, offering personal luxury cars at their
           existing dealerships. The Celica XX was the top-level product alongside
            the Celica at Japanese dealership sales channels called Toyota Corolla 
            Store. The Celica XX offered the same comforts of the Chaser hardtop 
            coupe, Mark II hardtop coupe, and the Crown hardtop coupe.

    1979 Toyota Celica XX 2000G (MA45)
    The Celica XX (pronounced "double X"[10]) is the 
    Japanese market name of the first generation Celica Supra.
     It was available with two straight-six engines and five trim 
     packages, beginning with the 2600G, 2600S, 2000G, 2000S and 
     the entry-level 2000L.[9] Six exterior body colours were offered, 
     while cloth upholstery patterns were specific to the trim package 
     in burgundy, brown or dark blue. Leather was offered in brown and
      only on the "G" trim package. Aluminium alloy wheels were only offered on the "G" trim package. Power 
      windows with driver-side express down, cruise control, power steering, AM/FM Stereo with a separate
       cassette player, and rear split folding seats were all standard. A parking brake handle was now
        located in the centre console.[9]
    
    Wipers were two-speed with an intermittent wipe and a rear wiper with
     electric defrost was included.[citation needed]
    
    In 1981, the Celica XX introduced the world's first navigation computer.[11]</p>

    <p>1978
        The Supra was offered with a 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp) 2.0 L 12-valve SOHC inline-six 
        engine (M-EU, chassis code MA45) or the 82 kW (110 hp; 111 PS) 2.6-litre 12-valve
         SOHC inline-six engine (4M-E, chassis code MA46). The Japanese model was also 
        available with the smaller 2.0 L engine, so buyers choose which yearly tax they were willing to pay according to vehicle size and engine displacement regulations. Both engines were equipped with electronic fuel injection.[6][12] The installation of the larger engine did obligate Japanese buyers to pay a higher annual road tax, making owning the car more expensive than the smaller Celica.
        
        The Supra was first exported outside Japan in January 1979.[13] The federalized model was originally equipped with a 110 hp (82 kW; 112 PS) 2.6-litre 12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine.
        
        Transmission options for the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive gear whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over 56 km/h (35 mph). The drivetrain for the Supra retained the T series solid rear axle configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional Limited Slip Differential) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension with coil springs, lateral track bar, and stabilizer bar. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar.
        
        The interior of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks as part of the convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the centre console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.
        
        1979
        The mid-1979 changes for the 1980 model year US model were mostly cosmetic. The interior received a redesigned centre console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x51⁄2 inch aluminium wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers as standard and the aluminium wheels were optional). In addition, body molded mudflaps became available. On cars finished in copper metallic and white, the mudflaps were painted the body colour while the mudflaps were left black on all other colours. On the rear of the mudflaps, the word "Celica" was painted in white lettering.[14]
        
        The official Supra site[6] also notes that there was an addition of optional leather-trimmed seating and automatic climate-control.

        1981 Supra with Sports Performance Package (MA47, US)
        In August 1980 (for the 1981 model year), the Supra received an upgrade in displacement with the 2.8-litre 5M-E engine shared with the Crown (S110). It was still a 12-valve SOHC engine, but had a power output of 116 hp (87 kW; 118 PS) and 145 lb⋅ft (197 N⋅m) of torque. The car's automatic transmission was changed to the revised Toyota A43D and it gained a revised final drive gearing. Because of the change in engine and transmission a new chassis code of MA47 was given to the 1981 model. Performance figures for this model include a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 10.24 seconds and a 1/4-mile time of 17.5 seconds at a speed of 77.7 mph (125 km/h).[15]
        
        Also in 1980 (for the 1981 model year), a new Sports Performance Package became an option, which included sport suspension, raised white letter tyres, and front and rear spoilers. This also marked the last year that an 8-track tape player was offered in any Supra.[6][14]</p>
