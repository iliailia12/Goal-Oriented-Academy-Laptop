        <h1>Lexus</h1>
        <header>Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota
             Motor Corporation. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide
             [3][6] and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. It has ranked among the 10 
             largest Japanese
              global brands in market value.[7] Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya,
             Japan. Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.

            Created at around the same time as Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura and 
            Infiniti
             luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project 
             to develop a new
              premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the
               Lexus LS in 1989.[8] Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV 
               models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles 
               marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota
                marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and
                 additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque
                  performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA
                   supercar in 2009.
            
            Lexus vehicles are largely produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and 
            Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka,
             Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus produced outside the country, the Canadian-built 
             RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus began 
             operating its own design, engineering and manufacturing centers.
            
            Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market, the United States.
             The division inaugurated dealerships in the Japanese domestic market in 2005, becoming the 
             first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin.[9] The brand has since 
             debuted in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe and other regions, and has introduced hybrid 
             vehicles in many markets.</header>
             <p>History</p>
             <main>1980s: The F1 project
                The Lexus brand was created around the same time as Japanese rivals Nissan and 
                Honda developed their Infiniti and Acura premium brands. The Japanese government
                 imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S. market, so it was more profitable
                  for Japanese automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S.
                
                In 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda issued a challenge to build the world's best 
                car.[10] The project, code-named F1 ("Flagship One")[11] developed the Lexus LS 400 to
                 expand Toyota's product line in the premium segment.[12] The F1 project followed the
                  Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models.[13] Both the Supra and
                   Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine.
                    The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production, 1960s-vintage
                     Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model,[14] followed
                      by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan.[14][15] The Century was 
                      conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with 
                the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982.[15] The F1 designers targeted 
                their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.[14][15]
                
                Japanese manufacturers exported more expensive models in the 1980s due to voluntary
                 export restraints negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives 
                 that restricted mainstream car sales.[16] In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque
                  in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division.[17] The initial Acura
                   model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as 
                   a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Gloria and Mazda Luce.[18] In 1987, Nissan
                    unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti,[19] and revised its Nissan President
                     sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti Q45, which it launched
                      in 1990.[20] Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America in 1988
                      and later began plans to develop an upscale marque to be called Amati, but its plans 
                      did not come to fruition.[19]
                
                Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct focus groups and market
                 research on luxury consumers.[21] During that time, several F1 designers rented a 
                 home in Laguna Beach, California, to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American 
                 upper class consumers.[21] Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing 
                 on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads.[22] Toyota's market research 
                 concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new sedan,
                  and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.[23]
                
                Brand development
                In 1986, Toyota's longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized
                 unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the new brand.[17] Image consulting firm
                  Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre,
                   Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates.[24] While Alexis
                    quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to 
                    people more than cars (being associated with the Alexis Carrington character
                     on the popular 1980s prime time drama Dynasty).[24][25] As a result, the 
                     first letter was removed and the "i" replaced with a "u" to morph the name 
                     to Lexus.[25]

                1989 LS 400 sedan was the first Lexus model.
                Theories of the etymology of the Lexus name have suggested it is the combination 
                of the words "luxury" and "elegance",[26] and that it is an acronym for "luxury
                 exports to the U.S."[26] According to Team One interviews, the brand name has no
                  specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image.[24] Prior 
                  to the release of the first vehicles, database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary
                   injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used because it might cause product 
                   confusion.[27] The injunction threatened to delay the division's launch and marketing
                    efforts.[27] The U.S. appeals court lifted the injunction, deciding that there was 
                    little likelihood of confusion between the two products.[27]
                
                The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became "The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection."[28] Three firms were involved in the final phase of logo development: Saatchi & Saatchi, Molly Designs and Hunter/Korobkin, Inc.[29] The finished logo was a combination of two firms' final designs: the Lexus logo typeface came from Saatchi & Saatchi and the "L" was Hunter/Korobkin, Inc.'s design. According to Toyota, the automaker made some refinements so the logo would be easier to manufacture, rendering it using a mathematical formula.[30][24] The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles and New York auto shows in 1988</main>
