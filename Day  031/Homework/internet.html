            <h1>Internet</h1>
            <p >The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks
                 that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and 
                 devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, 
                 and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic,
                  wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of
                   information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents 
                   and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

                The origins of the Internet date back to research that enabled the time-sharing of 
                computer resources and the development of packet switching in the 1960s. The set of
                rules (communication protocols) to enable internetworking on the Internet arose from
                 research and development commissioned in the 1970s by the Defense Advanced Research 
                 Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense in collaboration with 
                 universities and researchers across the United States and in the United Kingdom and France.
                  The ARPANET initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military
                   networks in the United States to enable resource sharing. The funding of the National Science 
                   Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, 
                as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, encouraged worldwide participation 
                in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks using DARPA's 
                Internet protocol suite. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s, 
            as well as the advent of the World Wide Web, marked the beginning of the transition to the modern
             Internet,and generated sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal,
              and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by 
              academia in the 1980s, the subsequent commercialization in the 1990s and beyond incorporated 
              its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
                
                Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and 
                newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new 
                services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, 
                and video streaming websites. Newspapers, books, and other print publishing have adapted to website 
                technology or have been reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. The Internet
                 has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet 
                 forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, 
                 small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence
                  to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and 
                  financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
                
                The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies
                 for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overarching definitions 
                 of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and
                  the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for
                   Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols
                    is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely
                     affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical
                      expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's
                       list of the New Seven Wonders.</p>

            <h2>Terminology and History</h2>
            <p>n the 1960s, computer scientists began developing systems for time-sharing of 
                computer resources. J. C. R. Licklider proposed the idea of a universal
                 network while working at Bolt Beranek & Newman and, later, leading the Information 
                 Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) 
                 of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Research into packet switching, one 
                 of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran at RAND in
                  the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies at the United Kingdom's National
                   Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1965. After the Symposium on Operating Systems 
                   Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network and dynamic 
                   routing concepts proposed by Baran were incorporated into the design of the ARPANET,
                   an experimental resource sharing network proposed by ARPA.


                ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between 
                the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute 
                (now SRI International) on 29 October 1969. The third site was at the University 
                of California, Santa Barbara, followed by the University of Utah. In a sign of future 
                growth, 15 sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971. These
                 early years were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource
                  Sharing.[30] Thereafter, the ARPANET gradually developed into a decentralized 
                  communications network, connecting remote centers and military bases in the
                   United States.[31] Other user networks and research networks, such as the 
                   Merit Network and CYCLADES, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
                
                Early international collaborations for the ARPANET were rare. Connections were made in 
                1973 to Norway (NORSAR and NDRE), and to Peter Kirstein's research group at University 
                College London (UCL), which provided a gateway to British academic networks, forming the
                 first internetwork for resource sharing.[34] ARPA projects, the International Network
                  Working Group and commercial initiatives led to the development of various protocols 
                  and standards by which multiple separate networks could become a single network or "a
                   network of networks".[35] In 1974, Vint Cerf at Stanford University and Bob Kahn at
                    DARPA published a proposal for "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication".
                    [36] They used the term internet as a shorthand for internetwork in RFC 675,[14]
                     and later RFCs repeated this use. Cerf and Kahn credit Louis Pouzin with important 
                     influences on the resulting TCP/IP design.[36][37] National PTTs and commercial 
                    providers developed the X.25 standard and deployed it on public data networks.[38]
                
                Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF)
                 funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite 
                 (TCP/IP) was standardized, which facilitated worldwide proliferation of interconnected 
                 networks. TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science
                  Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer sites in the United 
                  States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 
                  45 Mbit/s.[39] The NSFNet expanded into academic and research organizations in
                   Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 1988–89.[40][41][42][43] Although
                    other network protocols such as UUCP and PTT public data networks had global 
                    reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an
                     intercontinental network. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) 
                     emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.[44] The ARPANET
                      was decommissioned in 1990.[45]
                
                
                T3 NSFNET Backbone, c.1992
                Steady advances in semiconductor technology and optical networking created 
                new economic opportunities for commercial involvement in the expansion of
                 the network in its core and for delivering services to the public. In 
                 mid-1989, MCI Mail and Compuserve established connections to the Internet, 
                 delivering email and public access products to the half million users of 
                 the Internet.[46] Just months later, on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an 
                 alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that 
                 added to the core of the commercial Internet of later years. In March 1990,
                  the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was
                   installed between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust 
                   communications than were capable with satellites.[47]br

                Later in 1990, Tim Berners-Lee began writing WorldWideWeb, the first web
                 browser, after two years of lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990
                 , Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the 
                 HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9,[48] the HyperText Markup Language
                  (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also an HTML editor and could
                   access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files), the first HTTP server software 
                   (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server,[49] and the first Web 
                   pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the Commercial Internet 
                   eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other 
                   commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Stanford Federal Credit 
                   Union was the first financial institution to offer online Internet 
                   banking services to all of its members in October 1994.[50] In 1996,
                    OP Financial Group, also a cooperative bank, became the second online
                     bank in the world and the first in Europe.[51] By 1995, the Internet 
                     was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, 
                     removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial
                      traffic.
                
                Worldwide Internet users[53]
                2005	2010	2017	2023
                World population (billions)[54]	6.5	6.9	7.4	8.0
                Worldwide	16%	30%	48%	67%
                In developing world	8%	21%	41.3%	60%
                In developed world	51%	67%	81%	93%
                As technology advanced and commercial opportunities fueled reciprocal growth, the volume
                 of Internet traffic started experiencing similar characteristics as that of the scaling
                  of MOS transistors, exemplified by Moore's law, doubling every 18 months. This growth,
                   formalized as Edholm's law, was catalyzed by advances in MOS technology, laser light wave
                    systems, and noise performance. 
                
                Since 1995, the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including
                 the rise of near-instant communication by email, instant messaging, telephony
                  (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls, and
                   the World Wide Web[56] with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking
                    services, and online shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted
                     at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1 Gbit/s, 
                     10 Gbit/s, or more. The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever-greater 
                     amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social 
                     networking services.[57] During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic
                      on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual 
                      growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 
                      50%.[58] This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration,
                       which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature
                        of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents
                         any one company from exerting too much control over the network.[59] As of 31 
                         March 2011, the estimated total number of Internet users was 2.095 billion 
                         (30% of world population).[60] It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet
                          carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way
                 telecommunication. By 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than
                  97% of all telecommunicated 
                information was carried over the Internet.[61]</p>

            <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a 
                system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any 
                computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and 
                radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of internetworking, many of the
                 network nodes are not necessarily Internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried
                  by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking
                   standard, running across heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to 
                their destinations by IP routers.</p>
