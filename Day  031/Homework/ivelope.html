        <h1>Service tiers</h1>
        <p>Internet service providers (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity 
            between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who
             only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain 
             information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top 
             of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication 
             companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed 
             fiber-optic cables and governed by peering agreements. Tier 2 and lower-level
              networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some 
              parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An
               ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement
                multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing. Internet exchange 
                points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs.
                 Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and
                  governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and 
                  purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to
                   interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's
             national research and education network, JANET.</p>

             <h2>Access</h2>
             <p>Common methods of Internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via 
                telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, 
                satellite, and cellular telephone technology (e.g. 3G, 4G). The Internet may often be 
                accessed from computers in libraries and Internet cafés. Internet access points exist 
                in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, 
                such as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web payphone. Many hotels 
                also have public terminals that are usually
                 fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket 
                 booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the 
                 Internet via local computer networks. Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi 
                 cafés, where users need to bring their own wireless devices, such as a laptop or PDA.
                  These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.

                Grassroots efforts have led to wireless community networks. Commercial Wi-Fi 
                services that cover large areas are available in many cities, such as New York,
                 London, Vienna, Toronto, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburgh,
                  where the Internet can then be accessed from places such as a park bench.[68] 
                  Experiments have also been conducted with proprietary mobile wireless networks
                   like Ricochet, various high-speed data services over cellular networks, and
                    fixed wireless services. Modern smartphones can also access the Internet 
                    through the cellular carrier network. For Web browsing, these devices 
                    provide applications such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox and a
                     wide variety of other Internet software may be installed from app 
                     stores. Internet usage by mobile and tablet devices exceeded desktop
                      worldwide for the first time in October 2016.[69]
                
                Mobile communication
                
                Number of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012–2016
                The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimated that,
                 by the end of 2017, 48% of individual users regularly connect
                  to the Internet, up from 34% in 2012.[70] Mobile Internet
                   connectivity has played an important role in expanding 
                   access in recent years, especially in Asia and the Pacific
                    and in Africa.[71] The number of unique mobile cellular 
                    subscriptions increased from 3.9 billion in 2012 to 4.8 
                    billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world's population, with more than 
                    half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of 
                    subscriptions was predicted to rise to 5.7 billion users in 2020.[72] 
                    As of 2018, 80% of the world's population were covered by a 4G network.
                    [72] The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile
                     applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the 
                     Internet. Fragmentation restricts access to media content and tends 
                     to affect the poorest users the most.[71]
                

                Zero-rating, the practice of Internet service providers allowing users free
                 connectivity to access specific content or applications without cost, has 
                 offered opportunities to surmount economic hurdles but has also been accused
                  by its critics as creating a two-tiered Internet. To address the issues with
                   zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of 'equal rating'
                    and is being tested in experiments by Mozilla and Orange in Africa. Equal
                     rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a 
                     specified data cap. In a study published by Chatham House, 15 out of 19 countries researched
                      in Latin America had some kind of hybrid or zero-rated product offered. Some countries in
                       the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators)
                        while others, such as Colombia, offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.[73]
                
                A study of eight countries in the Global South found that zero-rated data plans exist in
                 every country, although there is a great range in the frequency with which they are offered and
                  actually used in each.[74] The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in 
                  Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines. Across the 181 plans examined,
                   13 percent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South
                    Africa, found Facebook's Free Basics and Wikipedia Zero to be the most commonly zero-rated content.</p>

                    <h3>Internet Protocol Suite</h3>
                    <p>The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite (also called
                         TCP/IP, based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered 
                         into a set of four conceptional layers by the scope of their operation, originally
                          documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. At the top is the application layer, where 
                          communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate 
                          for each application. For example, a web browser operates in a client–server application
                           model and exchanges information with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an application-germane 
                           data structure, such as the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).


                        Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a 
                        logical channel through the network. It provides this service with a variety of possible 
                        characteristics, such as ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).
                        
                        Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at
                         their borders and exchange traffic across them. The Internet layer implements the 
                         Internet Protocol (IP) which enables computers to identify and locate each other
                          by IP address and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.[76] 
                          The Internet Protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it 
                          is physically running over.
                        


                        At the bottom of the architecture is the link layer, which connects nodes on the 
                        same physical link, and contains protocols that do not require routers for
                         traversal to other links. The protocol suite does not explicitly specify 
                         hardware methods to transfer bits, or protocols to manage such hardware,
                          but assumes that appropriate technology is available. Examples of that 
                          technology include Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and DSL.
                        

                        
                        As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction 
                        layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted
                         over the wire at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is 
                         removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation 
                         at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.
                        Internet protocol
                        
                        Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (A and B) 
                        connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each 
                        host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly
                         connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After the establishment 
                         of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process,
                          as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower 
                          protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears
                           as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the
                            connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network 
                            boundaries are traversed at each router.
                        The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP).
                         IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. 
                         Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPv4 and IPv6.
                        
                        IP Addresses
                        
                        A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible 
                        "www.wikipedia.org" to determine the IPv4 Address 207.142.131.234.
                        For locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides IP addresses.
                         IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to 
                         their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the
                          packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via DHCP, or are configured.
                        <img src="UDP_encapsulation.svg.png" alt="" width="400">
                        However, the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter
                         domain names (e.g. "en.wikipedia.org") instead of IP addresses because they are
                          easier to remember; they are converted by the Domain Name System (DNS) into IP
                           addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.
                        
                        IPv4
                        Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number.[76] 
                        IPv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is 
                        still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ≈4.3 billion (109) hosts.
                         However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion
                         , which entered its final stage in 2011,[77] when the global IPv4 address alloca
                         tion pool was exhausted.
                        
                        IPv6
                        Because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 
                        addresses, a new version of IP IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998.[78][79][80] IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s and is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.[81]
                        
                        IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it
                         establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible
                          with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for 
                          internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software 
                          for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating 
                          systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network
                           infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development.
                            Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make 
                            up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or 
                            multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements,
                             and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the 
                             exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined 
                             by its interconnections and routing policies</p>
