            <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
            <p>The World Wide Web is a global collection of documents, images, multimedia,
                 applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and
                  referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which provide a global 
                  system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services, web servers, 
                  databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext 
                  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web.
                   Web services also use HTTP for communication between software systems for 
                   information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistics 
                   and is one of many languages or protocols that can 
                be used for communication on the Internet.[86]</p>

            <h2>world wide web evelope</h2>
            <p>World Wide Web browser software, such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer/Edge,
                 Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Apple's Safari, and Google Chrome, enable users to
                  navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the 
                  documents. These documents may also contain any combination of computer 
                  data, including graphics, sounds, text, 
                video, multimedia and interactive content that runs while the user is 
                interacting with the page. Client-side software can include animations,
                 games, office applications and scientific demonstrations. Through 
                 keyword-driven Internet research using search engines like Yahoo!, 
                 Bing and Google, users worldwide have easy, instant access to a 
                 vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed
                  media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide 
                  Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.

                The Web has enabled individuals and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially
                 large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or 
                 building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available. However,
                  publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date 
                  information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies 
                  and groups use web logs or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some
                   commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in 
                   the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information and be
                    attracted to the corporation as a result.
                
                Advertising on popular web pages can be lucrative, and e-commerce, which is the sale of products and
                 services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of marketing 
                 and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers.
                  It includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, many types 
                  ]of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising. In 2011,
                   Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of cable television and
                    nearly exceeded those of broadcast television.[87]: 19  Many common online advertising practices are 
                    controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.
                
                When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web
                 server, formatted in HTML, ready for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time,
                  the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout,
                  
                  and content. Websites are often created using content management software with, initially, very little
                   content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public,
                    fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual
                     visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval 
                     and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it
                      available to the target visitors.

                Communication
                Email is an important communications service available via the Internet. The concept of 
                sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, 
                predates the creation of the Internet.[88][89] Pictures, documents, and other files are 
                sent as email attachments. Email messages can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses.
                
                Internet telephony is a common communications service realized with the Internet. The
                 name of the principal internetworking protocol, the Internet Protocol, lends its
                  name to voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The idea began in the early 1990s
                   with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. VoIP systems
                    now dominate many markets and are as easy to use and as convenient as a traditional 
                    telephone. The benefit has been substantial cost savings over traditional telephone 
                    calls, especially over long distances. Cable, ADSL, and mobile data networks provide
                     Internet access in customer premises[90] and inexpensive VoIP network adapters provide 
                     the connection for traditional analog telephone sets. The voice quality of VoIP often
                      exceeds that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include the situation
                       that emergency services may not be universally available and that devices rely on a
                        local power supply, while older traditional phones are powered from the local loop
                        , and typically operate during a power failure.
                
                Data transfer
                File sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet.
                 A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment.
                  It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download 
                  by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a file server for instant use 
                  by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "mirror"
                   servers or peer-to-peer networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by 
                   user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and
                    money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of
                     funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across 
                     the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures
                      or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis,
                       are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a 
                       computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software 
                       products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn
                        has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled 
                        the production and distribution of these products.
                
                Streaming media is the real-time delivery of digital media for immediate consumption or enjoyment
                 by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio
                  and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access online media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where—usually audio—material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide. Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.[91]
                
                Webcams are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate 
                video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals
                 around an African waterhole, ships in the Panama Canal, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor 
                 their own premises, live and in real time. Video chat rooms and video conferencing are also 
                 popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound.
                  YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming 
                  video with more than two billion users.[92] It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to
                   stream and show video files.[93] Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video 
                   and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of
                    millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.
                
                Social impact
                The Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations.
                 This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet. The early
                  Internet left an impact on some writers who used symbolism to write about it, such as describing t

                    <h1>Users</h1>
                    <p>Between 2000 and 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 390
                         million to 1.9 billion.[98] By 2010, 22% of the world's population had access to 
                         computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users
                          reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube.[99] In 2014 the world's 
                          Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 44 percent of world population, but two-thirds 
                          came from the richest countries, with 7
                        8 percent of Europeans using the Internet, followed by 57 percent of the Americas.[100
                        ] However, by 2018, Asia alone accounted for 51% of all Internet users, with 2.2 billion 
                        out of the 4.3 billion Internet users in the world. China's Internet users surpassed a 
                        major milestone in 2018, when the country's Internet regulatory authority, China Internet
                         Network Information Centre, announced that China had 802 million users.[101] China was 
                         followed by India, with some 700 million users, with the United States third with 275 
                         million users. However, in terms of penetration, in 2022 China had a 70% penetration 
                         rate compared to India's 60% and the United States's 90%.[102] In 2022, 54% of the world's 
                         Internet users were based in Asia, 14% in Europe, 7% in North America, 10% in Latin America
                          and the Caribbean, 11% in Africa, 4% in the Middle East and 1% in Oceania.[103] In 2019, 
                          Kuwait, Qatar, the Falkland Islands, Bermuda and Iceland had the highest Internet penetration
                           by the number of users, with 93% or more of the population with access.[104] As of 2022, it 
                           was estimated that 5.4 billion people use the Internet, more than two-thirds of the world's 
                           population.[105]

                        The prevalent language for communication via the Internet has always been English. This may be
                         a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a lingua franca and 
                         as a world language. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the American 
                         Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), a subset of the Latin alphabet. After 
                         English (27%), the most requested languages on the World Wide Web are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%),
                          Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and 
                          Korean (2%).[106] The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years,
                           especially in the use of Unicode, that good facilities are available for development
                            and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such
                             as mojibake (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.
                        
                        In a US study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead 
                        of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men
                         logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband 
                         users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). 
                         Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for
                          recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to 
                          use the Internet for shopping and banking.[107] In 2008, women significantly outnumbered
                           men on most social networking services, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the 
                           ratios varied with age.[108] Women watched more streaming content, whereas men 
                           downloaded more.[109] Men were more likely to blog. Among those who blog, men 
                           were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely 
                           to have a personal blog.[110]
                        
                        Several neologisms exist that refer to Internet users: Netizen (as in "citizen of 
                        the net")[111] refers to those actively involved in improving online communities,
                         the Internet in general or surrounding political affairs and rights such as free
                          speech,[112][113] Internaut refers to operators or technically highly capable u
                          sers of the Internet,[114][115] digital citizen refers to a person using the 
                          Internet in order to engage in society, politics, and government participation.[116]</p>
